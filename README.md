# Polynomial-Linear-Regression
This project uses Polynomial Linear Regression to predict employee salaries based on their position and check whether a proposed salary is a bluff or not. By modeling the non-linear relationship between job position and salary, the regression model offers a reliable way to verify the accuracy of salary claims.
